# Adriano Guido Fossati

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adriano G. Fossati, I graduated in biology at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. I'm currently in post-graduate studies in marine biology at the University of Algarve, Portugal. 
I am currently doing my master thesis as a visitor researcher at QUT in Brisbane, Australia. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data science, Marine ecology and coral reefs. 

My master project is about the Tropicalisation of eastern Australian reef fish communities under climate change. In that matter, all the codes and repositories will be coming public once I submitted my thesis (end of September 2024).
