# Adriano Guido Fossati

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Adriano G. Fossati, I graduated in biology at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. I'm currently in post-graduation studies in marine biology at the University of Algarve, Portugal, and I am doing my master thesis as a visitor researcher at QUT in Brisbane, Australia. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data science, Marine ecology and coral reefs. 

My current focus of research are reef fishes along the eastern coast of Australia, their ecology, and their tropicalisation due to climate change.
